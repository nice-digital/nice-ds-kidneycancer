    "abstract = \"Lymphedema is a common complication of axillary dissection and thus emphasis should be placed on prevention. Fifty-five women who had breast-conserving surgery or modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer with axillary dissection were randomly assigned to either the preventive protocol (PG) or control group (CG) and assessments were made preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively. Arm volume (VOL) was used as measurement of arm lymphedema. Clinically significant lymphedema was confirmed by an increase of at least 200 ml from the preoperative difference between the two arms. The preventive protocol for the PG women included preoperative upper limb lymphscintigraphy (LS), principles for lymphedema risk minimization, and early management of this condition when it was identified. Assessments at 2 years postoperatively were completed for 89% of the 55 women who were randomly assigned to either PG or CG. Of the 49 women with unilateral breast cancer surgery who were measured at 24 months, 10 (21%) were identified with secondary lymphedema using VOL with an incidence of 8% in PG women and 33% in CG women. These prophylactic strategies appear to reduce the development of secondary lymphedema and alter its progression in comparison to the CG women\"\n",

    "abstract = \"BACKGROUND: The diagnostic performance of dedicated positron emission mammary (PEM) using fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in evaluating suspicious breast lesions has been investigated by several authors, with conflicting results. Aim of our study is to meta-analyze published data about this topic, in order to add evidence-based data in this setting  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a comprehensive computer literature search of studies published in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, or Embase databases through February 10, 2013, regarding the diagnostic performance of PEM using FDG in women with breast lesions. Only studies comprising > 10 patients who underwent PEM were included in the meta-analysis, for statistical purposes. Pooled sensitivity and specificity on a per lesion-based analysis were calculated to assess the diagnostic performance of PEM using FDG in this setting  RESULTS: Our meta-analysis evaluated 8 studies comprising 873 women with breast lesions. Pooled sensitivity and specificity values of PEM using FDG in women with suspected breast malignancy were 85% (95% CI, 83%-88%) and 79% (95% CI, 74%-83%), respectively, on a per lesion-based analysis. The included studies were heterogeneous in their estimate of sensitivity and specificity  CONCLUSION: PEM using FDG is a sensitive and specific tool for the evaluation of suspicious breast lesions. The detection of additional lesions and extensive intraductal involvement is improved, with comparable accuracy, over that of MRI in the depiction of invasive breast cancers.Copyright 2014 Elsevier Inc.\"\n",
